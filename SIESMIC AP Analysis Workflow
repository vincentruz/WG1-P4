SIESMIC AP Analysis Workflow

1.	Data Processing (Institution Specific - see here for shared SEISMIC variable names)
  a.	Load R pkgs
  b.	Load full dataset
  c.	Student level variables
    i.	Rename std level variables
    ii.	Generate/recode std level variables
    iii.	Create std level variable dataframe
  d.	Course level variables
    i.	Rename crs level variables
    ii.	Generate/recode crs level variables
    iii.	Create crs level variable dataframe
    iv.	By course 1 and 2: 
      1.	Create dataframe of only first time taking 1st and 2nd course
  e.	AP Level variables
    i.	By AP subject
      1.	Rename AP level variables
      2.	Generate/recode AP level variables
      3.	Create dataframe
  f.	Create stacked dataset
    i.	By course subject:
      1.	Join dataframes for first time taking Course1, Course2, and AP
    ii.	Stack each subject by course
      1.	Include new variable: “discipline” as flag for each subject
        a.	"BIO", "CHEM", "PHYS"
    iii.	Should end up with something that looks like this.
